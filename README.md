We implemented recursive client functionality by making sure the client kept querying until a response was returned. In order to do so, it first combed through the list of the RS and if no response was returned, then it would comb through the list of the TS. There was a full response generated for each query. 

There are no issues in the project, everything is working seamlessly.

The main problem we faced was establishing a connection between a server and client on two remote machines. However by following the proper procedure to connect sockets to each other, the problem was surmounted.

We learned a great deal of things working on this project. One thing we gained was a better understanding of the Python language. Another thing, was how to properly implement servers and clients on the computer using sockets. And lastly we learned the basics on how a DNS system works.
